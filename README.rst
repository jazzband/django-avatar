Django-avatar is a reusable application for handling user avatars.  It has the
ability to default to Gravatar if no avatar is found for a certain user.
Django-avatar automatically generates thumbnails and stores them to your default
file storage backend for retrieval later.

For more information see the documentation at http://django-avatar2.readthedocs.org/
